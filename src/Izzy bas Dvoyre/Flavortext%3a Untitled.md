I'd love to say that nobody in the bookstore took much note of the purple eyes, but the one lady who keeps showing up just to flirt with the boys and me did run into an issue.

My control of this was still a little wild at the time, and it shouldn't have been a problem if I was busy reshelving and cataloging, which means a lot of facing shelves instead of customers. Millie didn't seem to think my methodical work was worth letting me do undisturbed, so she instead added a hand to my clipboard on the shelving cart as I was turning to it. I whipped it out from under her hand with my left and went for her shoulder with my right to steady her and shuffle her a few steps away, wordlessly and without looking up.

I was just as much a fool to trust Mildred with her own balance and with genuinely innocent physical touch as her unborn self was to trust her old man with her great-aunt's name.

Whatever possessed her to, she gripped for my forearm and still flailed so dramatically that she ended up over my chest and I on my butt and elbows. Even if I were any better with regard to my own composure at the time, I am so insanely grateful for the whole section being empty at the time.

As mentioned, the proximity did wonders for my composure, especially given how tense she and I seemed to remain. A lot can be conveyed even (and particularly) when all someone is doing is breathing and staring.

Only then did I realize her eyes were picking up the faintest flecks of iridescent magenta not unlike on the eyes of the chambermaid who walked in on us when Harke turned her away that one night.

This set my mind racing, so I flicked my eyes to the carpeted floor on either side of her. Her bag made it to the floor nearby. I tried my luck:
"Millie, you happen to have a mirror?"
She managed to eke out the littlest twitch of a nod and no more.
"Great. Could you sit up and find it in your bag, please?"

The mirror was—unlike her—smooth, pristine, and not shattered in my lap.
