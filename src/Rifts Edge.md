The Estates are... honestly it's easiest to think of them as kingdoms. Each about the size of Alaska.
Each ruled by a head of estate with the same surname as the name of the estate
The Pavek Estate is ruled by Abiola Pavek
Reynier Carin rules the Carin Estate
Jyoshi Sandoval rules the Sandoval Estate
Almena Spinoza rules the Spinoza Estate
The ruler of Beville hasn't been named yet
And a neutral territory is smack dab in the middle. That's called Ostolaza.

These estates are where the majority of all humans live. They do frequently venture into the lands inhabited by other species, but they have so much drama that other species usually try not to get involved.
