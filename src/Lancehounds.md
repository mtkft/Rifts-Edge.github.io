# Lancehounds

## About
Essentially Paladins with extra steps.

## Lancehound Classes

### Barbarian
- Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. These Hounds sacrifice heavy armor in favor of being able to move quickly and deal massive damage. When raging, they will fight with everything they have until either the enemy is eliminated, or they are. 

### Paladin
- For when defense is your best defense. These hounds wear heavy armor, and frequently carry shields. Though this slows them down, once they've established a defensive position, there is almost no force that can shake them. Intimidation or drawing enemy aggression to themselves are their usual modes of operation, allowing those they protect to attack from afar or to flee.

## Lancehound Types

### Lancehound Devotee
- Lancehounds who serve as the personal bodyguard to a Head of Estate (or to the Heir of the same title). Their oath is to their Charge, and to Harke, Goddess of Devotion.
    - A Lancehound Devotee and their Charge share a bond like no other. Through their bond, strengthened by their Goddess, senses and even thoughts can be shared between Lancehound and Charge.

### Lancehound Cavalier
- The most common type of Lancehound. Your average Knight in Shining Armor. Their oath is to their chosen Deity and their Estate, in that order.

### Lancehound Oathbreaker
- Lancehounds who have broken their oath to their Estate due to their orders violating their oath to their Deity. Their secondary oath is now to their found family, or the people of the community in which they choose to reside.
    - Riothounds are a subset of Oathbreakers. They reside within their communities in secret, only donning their armor and raising their weapon during protests and riots before slipping back into the shadows when their people are safe. They've been known to kill Cavaliers in battle.
    - True Oathbreakers are rare. 

### Lancehound Pathwalker
- Lancehounds that are self-trained, or trained unofficially by another Lancehound. Their oath is to their Deity, and they often act as adventurers or mercenaries.
