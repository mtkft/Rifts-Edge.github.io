## Lancehound Types

### Lancehound Bodyguard 
- Lancehounds who serve as the personal bodyguard to a Head of Estate (or to the Heir of the same title). Their oath is to their Charge, and to Harke, Goddess of Devotion.
    - A Lancehound Bodyguard and their Charge share a bond like no other. Through their bond, strengthened by their Goddess, senses and even thoughts can be shared between Lancehound and Charge.

### Lancehound Cavalier
- The most common type of Lancehound. Your average Knight in Shining Armor. Their oath is both to their Deity and their Estate, in that order.

### Lancehound Oathbreaker
- Lancehounds who have broken their Oath to their Estate due to their orders violating their oath to their Deity. Their secondary oath is now to the people of the community in which they choose to reside.
    - Riothounds are a subset of Oathbreakers. They reside within their communities in secret, only donning their armor and raising their weapon during protests and riots before slipping back into the shadows when their people are safe. They've been known to kill Chevaliers in battle.

### Lancehound Pathwalker
- Lancehounds that are self-trained, or trained unofficially by another Lancehound. Their oath is to their Deity, and they often act as adventurers or mercenaries.
