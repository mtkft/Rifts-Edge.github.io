# The Halfling Shepherd

Picture me this. Maximum security prison. Full of all the scariest dudes out there. But who’s the one that even the guards are afraid of?
The sweetest looking little halfling you’ve ever seen.
Former Shepherd Elder. Slew her entire flock, including the other Shepherds. Turned herself in afterwards. Admitted to everything, but gave no motive, and one still hasn’t been deduced. She was given multiple life sentences. … honestly, she could probably pull off an escape. She’s not gonna bother trying, though. Probably.
Izzy would most likely know of her. Might have even met with her once. She knows everything that goes on in that prison.
