From the top? Alright, from the top. But for the record, I still don't think you lot need to know who sent me.

All's I'll let on is that they're among the bevy of sentimental types who still tell each other the old stories about demigods and flasks and some twink who fucking integrated one of them.

_Fascinating. If you don't give us anything useful we don't pour you another and the lights go out._

You dry fuckin scoundrels, you're being regaled with only the most relevant of background! And on top of that, you can't appreciate a solid weaver of tales when she looks you in the mug?

_Did I stutter? Gerron with it._

Suit yourselves!

Aaaanywhooo... One of these sentimental types caught wind of some weird deaths in the hills where Spinozen rule is meant to end, if the pith-helmeted Pavek grunts could hold it together. I guess it cropped up in failed tribute collection visits, which I guess just says something about dedicated bureaucrats who follow any thread and break a huge story about it.

Word on the street in Valemire is Kyra Macllroy has some chambermaid or another who's just so fuckoff pretty that when people see her on the balcony beating a carpet they try to huff the airborne dust and crud, they get laughed at for having it so bad, they catastrophize not getting to ever ask her out, and they throw themselves in a well. It's taken guys and girls alike, and not just the humans. Needless to say the citizenry were in for a treat when they learned how gruesome the corpse of a tiefling looks being hauled up by a horn.

Some true Imperial believer and baffling appointee in Revenue and Excise got the thought this sounds like someone who invites legendary commitment—hell, even holy, maybe?—and must have nommed one mushroom too many, because he started ranting to his mistress about how she could be the deity of devotion. The mistress gossipped over the butcher's counter, the butcher's wife told her book club, and it made it to my ear in the bookshop from behind my tea and scone. My supervisor was also busy getting wrong ideas about me so he was on the shift he swapped at the time—so much for no contact while in civvies or, in his case, undercover.

Whatever, this apparently interested Leadership over their dumb game and fowl dinner and I got orders to worm into the chambermai—ehem. The chambers at Manor Macllroy.

_You horny bastard. Have you no sense of duty? I can't even say "think with your dick" about how you act!_

How do *you* claim to know what's in my pants?

[Dull thunk of Izzy getting pistolwhipped. She wakes up only later in her cell]

not that these guard boys care, izzy continues

I didn't figure my odds would be too high being let in just knocking on the door, whether the infamous Kyra was home or no. So I did what I do best: I snuck in! Not hard when they're dusting and airing the chambers out every week. Of course, it was about not being discovered at the wrong time or by the wrong person or persons. To complicate matters, the open window I got the use of was a few down from the one I really wanted for the chamber I had figured out Harke usually works in on a weekly basis. This didn't mean much more than a bit of tiptoeing the blind corners for just a bit of one upstairs hall.

I wasn't even getting it on with a hot woman and I hope I wasn't being noisy, so it was a little devastating to get walked in on. Not just for my whole professional self-image, but for that whole "don't get detected ahead of time" thing.
